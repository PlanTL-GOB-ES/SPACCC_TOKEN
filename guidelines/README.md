# Guidelines

The annotation guidelines describe the criteria that have been followed to annotate the corpus, along with illustrative examples. They describe FreeLing3.1 default resources, the criteria that have been followed in the manual annotation and the implementations that solve these criteria in automatic annotation. The guidelines also compare the criteria followed in this project with those followed by the Apache CTAKES NLP system (http://ctakes.apache.org/) as well as the criteria followed in the development of the GENIA corpus (https://github.com/spyysalo/genia-pos).

Guidelines have been written and developed in Spanish and are only available in Spanish.
